# Developing in the web platform

> In this lesson we will take a tour of the Web Platform. What is it, exactly, and what it can do for language documentation? 


### Predecessors of documentation


Linguistic scholarship is very old. In fact, it’s almost as old as writing. Below you see a photo and two drawings of a ca.

  Visual documents associate physical space with various kinds of “meaning”. Each of these three objects encodes the same clay tablet, but with varied kinds of “fidelity”. The third drawing, in particular, begins a process of abstracting away from the original object to something more readily identifiable as a “column” layout. 

  A Mesopotamian scribe would recognize both the format and contents of the photographed tablet immediately; it is a “lexical list” of translations for various Sumerian terms for sheep into Akkadian. 

  * Is this fieldwork? Video of writing cuneiform



  * This structure is similar to a spreadsheet, in some ways. Does this mean that “databases” are also very old? It depends on how you define “database”.

### There are many types of data in use in language documentation and description

* we can categorize those types along several axes:

the speech context in which they were produced

1. speaking directly to a speaker?
2. working with an audio or video recording of 1? (also, degrees of separation fo linguist - own work?)
3. “legacy” documentation - produced by another linguist, 



## Modern documentation and the Boasian trilogy

  * fieldwork nostalgia
  * Sapir with laptop
  * Heath 3-volume thing
  * Australian stuff? 
  * Loma syllabary book
  * Kashaya 

* Trapped documentation
  * Kashaya dictionary
  * 

* What is a document? PDF, images, versus “data”
* Archives often provide PDFs and images, and sometimes EAF files
* but annotation in EAF is a tricky business
* we want a digital Boasian trilogy
  1. words
  1. texts
  1. grammar (grammatical categorization of words, syntax, morphemes, etc)
* Less often mentioned but also crucial:
  * phonetic inventory/orthography

* Nowadays, given readily available recording equipment, we want:
  * aligned media


* software
* data 
* document/application



## The Internet and the World Wide Web

This course is about the Web Platform, which you might not be familiar with. But the Web Platform is an evolutionary descendent of the World Wide Web (or just “the web”), which are very much familiar with. Everybody knows that the “web” is a bunch of websites where you can find a lot of stuff, right?

Yes, of course that is the case. 


Unlike, say, traditional word processing documents made in an application like Microsoft Word or LaTeX, web documents can be linked together via “hyperlinks”. Once a web document has been “hosted” on a computer that is connected to the internet (more on that later), links that the document contains can point anywhere else on the internet. This fundamental trick is at the root of the whole mess that we call the web today.

## Putting a simple lexicon on the web




1. To publish `HTML` documents containing well-structured documentation
2. To publish interactive _applications_ that allow users to create, edit, and otherwise interact with documentary data.

To start with something concrete, we’ll be looking at the design and development of a useful web lexicon.


## A little data

Here is a small sample lexicon. For now, we’ll start with some rather random Esperanto words.

<figure>
<include-pre src=/data/esperanto_sample-lexicon.txt></include-pre>
<figcaption><code><a href=""></a></code>A small lexicon of Esperanto, with morphological glosses.</figcaption>
</figure>

This content is available as a “stand-alone” file here, click it to take a look: 

<a href=/data/esperanto_sample-lexicon.txt>/data/esperanto_sample-lexicon.txt</a>

> If the text you see looks corrupted at that link, don’t worry too much, as we’ll be setting up some defaults soon that will prevent such misrendering (the same defaults we’re using in the current page in order to get the content above to render correctly). But if you would like an explanation, see the skill [Make Sure it’s Unicode](../../skills/make-sure-its-unicode/make-sure-its-unicode.html).


## Browsers read text files

We’re all used to using web browsers on a day-to-day basis, but it’s worth pausing to ask what a web browser actually _does_. As we saw in the link above, one thing a web browser can do is to read “plain text” files, which are (usually) recognizable by the `.txt` suffix in their file name.


## A Handful of Tags

The World Wide Web, as it is known today, has its origins in the publication and sharing of academic documents. Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues at CERN wanted to make it easier for particle physicists to exchange working papers and links to data files of various kinds. 


##  The Web Platform

The Web _Platform_, on the other hand, is something else — something newer, and something different from .
