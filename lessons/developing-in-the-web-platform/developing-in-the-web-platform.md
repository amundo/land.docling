# Developing in the web platform

In this lesson we will take a tour of the Web Platform: what it is, and what it can do for language documentation. 

There are two main ways in which we will want to make use of the Web Platform:

1. To publish `HTML` documents containing well-structured documentation
2. To publish interactive _applications_ that allow users to create, edit, and otherwise interact with documentary data.

To start with something concrete, we’ll be looking at the design and development of a useful web lexicon.


## A little data

Here is a small sample lexicon. For now, we’ll start with some rather random Esperanto words.

<figure>
<include-pre src=/data/sample_esperanto-lexicon.txt></include-pre>
<figcaption><code><a href=""></a></code>A small lexicon of Esperanto, with morphological glosses.</figcaption>
</figure>

This content is available as a “stand-alone” file here, click it to take a look: 

<a href=/data/sample_esperanto-lexicon.txt>/data/sample_esperanto-lexicon.txt</a>

> If the text you see looks corrupted at that link, don’t worry too much, as we’ll be setting up some defaults soon that will prevent such misrendering (the same defaults we’re using in the current page in order to get the content above to render correctly). But if you would like an explanation, see the skill [Make Sure it’s Unicode](../../skills/make-sure-its-unicode/make-sure-its-unicode.html).

## Browsers read text files

We’re all used to using web browsers on a day-to-day basis, but it’s worth pausing to ask what a web browser actually _does_. As we saw in the link above, one thing a web browser can do is to read “plain text” files, which are (usually) recognizable by the `.txt` suffix in their file name.


## A Handful of Tags

The World Wide Web, as it is known today, has its origins in the publication and sharing of academic documents. Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues at CERN wanted to make it easier for particle physicists to exchange working papers and links to data files of various kinds.
