<p>[2114] So in a which brings us to the topic of accessibility, [2142]
which is the next skill in this skill, [2146] we’re gonna talk a little
bit about the notion of accessibility, [2149] which is an area where the
web actually excels compared to other platforms. [2154] Um the web is
meant to be a universal information system and it should be usable by
people who access it in a whole variety of modalities, [2168] including
the non visual modality. [2170] So many people make use of the web with
audio interface. [2177] Blind users, [2178] people with vision
difficulties. [2181] And I think it’s really one of the coolest features
about the web is that this is possible. [2195] Accessibility is not just
a matter of equality, [2211] although it is that it’s also a kind of
ideal for making digital content as flexible as possible and as usable
in as many different contexts as possible. [2239] So, [2240] in this
section we’re going to just think a little bit about how our page will
behave in an audio medium. [2256] So I think that it’s important for us
to try this early on and I will also add that I’m not an expert in
accessibility, [2268] I’ve done what I can to learn and it’s an ongoing
process, [2274] it is the kind of thing that it pays to investigate
early because once you’ve created a lot of content, [2281] it can be
difficult to go back and make it more accessible if it has a lot of
problems embedded in it. [2292] But I’m happily that most important
thing that you can do for accessibility, [2302] it’s just to use good
html to mark up your content in a very meaningful away as possible.
[2309] So, [2310] as I mentioned last time, [2312] we’re going to have a
discussion of the so called semantics of a Chanel tags in a later skill.
[2332] But I think it’s important to bear in mind you’ll remember that
we talked about that pre tag early on as an example of a way to sort of
use white space to encode seemingly encode visual structure. [2349] And
I think you’ll agree that that was not terribly, [2458] I think that you
can at least uh appreciate the idea that there’s no way that the
computer would know that any particular line in this sort of visual
arrangement has any internal structure. [2475] We haven’t actually said
anything beyond laying this out in a visual way, [2482] if you see what
I mean. [2482] So um so we could, [2490] for instance, [2491] make a
pronoun table and line things up visually in our pro down table and
display it in a web page using a pre tag. [2546] And I think you’ll
agree that this um content doesn’t help the computer to I guess know
about the content of this tag, [2566] right? [2567] It doesn’t have any
kind of we can say that it’s not granular. [2573] The parts of this data
are not labeled in this All right encoding of the content. [2582] This
representation of the content. [2584] So what’s the alternative? [2597]
Well, [2598] as we saw in the last skill about block level and in line
level elements, [2607] it’s possible to nest tags inside of other tags.
[2611] And so this is a really crucial feature of html. [2617] Is that
you can build these kind of tree structures and then display them in a
way that’s legible in the visual medium, [2626] but also navigable in a
non visual medium. [2632] That’s what accessibility is. [2633] You can
access the content without In more than one way. [2639] Right. [2640]
And what that boils down to saying is that the structure of the content
as it’s encoded for the computer to parse and to render is a tree.
[2654] It has internal structure. [2659] So you could say that in this p
tag here that it contains two other tags. [2666] It contains a strong
tag and an emphasis tags. [2670] So that might seem sort of trivial.
[2677] But that basic concept is really quite important for the notion
of accessibility and for the whole model of the web platform, [2689] is
this idea that we can create these nested structures that look like the
kinds of documents that we’re familiar with but which also encode a
granular representation. [2702] That is to say um hierarchical
representation of information and that we can later refer to different
parts of that document in useful ways. [2716] So this is the notion of
granularity and it’s going to be an important one, [2723] not just an
html, [2724] but also in Jason and in CSS. [2782] So granularity and um
hierarchy, [2788] nesting, [2789] whatever call it. [2825] So that’s
accessibility. [2826] A little bit about accessibility. [2835] Then I
guess at this point you want to get to like um the dom right document
object model. [2849] So the document.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first rule of ARIA use in HTML states that you should avoid using
ARIA if there is a native HTML element with the semantics of behavior
that you require already built in. If such an element exists, you should
reach for that element instead.</p>
