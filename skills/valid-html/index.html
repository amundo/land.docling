<p>[378] so but let’s talk about validity in the next skill. [393] So
the next skill is validate your html lest you be thinking that we’re
going to be writing massive amounts of html ourselves. [402] That’s not
the case. [403] We’re just gonna get to know the basic system. [407] But
I think that at least familiarizing ourselves with the notion of a valid
document is a useful exercise. [428] So a valid document is one that
obeys the rules of the specification that it’s attempting to use. [434]
So html is a quite a complicated specification. [439] There’s a a
website that you can look at that has the gruesome details and it is
pretty gruesome. [450] It’s quite an old language at this point. [452]
It’s very powerful and it has evolved a lot and been standardized a lot.
[457] So the specification is not intended for new learners. [463] It’s
for people who want to create a new browser, [465] which is an
incredibly difficult undertaking. [469] But it’s out there and you can
look at it if you are curious. [476] But a more realistic way to
interact with the definition of html is just see if you can make a valid
page. [485] So if we take our document and we go to this validator,
[491] we’ll see that there’s more than one way to use it. [493] You can
either upload a file or you can just paste the content of the file into
this little text box here and we’ll do that. [502] The third way is to
pass A U. [503] R. [503] L. [504] And then this validator will go off
and get that content and check it that way. [521] So if we paste are
very simple. [524] one Tag page into this validator, [528] we’re going
to see that there’s an error. [531] So the error is here. [534] It says
no doc type declared. [537] So this is kind of a an odd tag and it’s
kind of odd that it comes up so quickly. [555] But this particular tag
is it has a long and sort of squirrely history and that it doesn’t look
like other html tags. [567] But you have to begin your html file with
this little thing which is called the doc type declaration. [574] So
there are other doc types in the world that are also like html. [580]
The most familiar is xml. [582] Xml also has a doc type declaration,
[584] which is more complicated. [585] The html one thankfully is quite
short nowadays. [589] So all you have to do is it doesn’t have a closing
tag and it has a very curious exclamation point after the inside the
opening tag. [602] So it looks like this says doc type and then html.
[606] So this needs to be the beginning of our html file. [609] And I
think you know, [610] what I usually do is I have a little boilerplate
basic html which I’ll share with you and you should just start your html
pages. [618] That way. [619] V. [619] S code can actually help you to do
this. [627] So I’ll show you that later. [629] But so if we add this doc
type declaration, [633] we see that the error goes away. [635] However,
[636] we do have a warning. [638] So however, [640] the this page is in
fact valid even though it has nothing no content just to a doc type in a
title. [648] So there you go. [649] You’ve created a valid html
page.</p>
