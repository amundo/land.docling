<p>[1050] So the next thing we need to do is to get a little bit of an
idea about the next skill is understand white space in html. [1058] This
seems like a very obscure topic but pretty important when it if you want
to understand how this system works. [1068] So let’s take our page now.
[1071] It’s saved as in the starting files, [1075] it’s saved as hello
world dot html. [1091] And this time we’ve added a single tag to the
content of the page and it doesn’t actually change much except that it
makes the font size larger. [1101] So The tag that we’re using here is
H1 that stands for first level heading. [1110] We’re heading level one
that’s the biggest font size, [1113] our biggest heading level. [1116]
It’s not unlike headings in uh like software or other word processing
programs. [1124] So it so happens for kind of weird historical reasons.
[1128] There are six levels of headings and then stops. [1131] So you’ve
got a church one H two H three up to age six and those are each slightly
smaller. [1137] We’ll try those out in a minute. [1139] But the basic
idea is that on an html page you should only have one H one per page.
[1145] That’s the Nothing’s stopping you from adding more than one.
[1148] But that’s the idea is that every page should have one each one.
[1155] So we put our thai text inside of this H one. [1158] If we save
it and then reload it, [1160] you’ll see that the text is now larger,
[1162] right? [1163] Um hardly surprising, [1167] but now I want to show
you something which is kind of interesting if we take this content and
we go inside of this tag and then we add a bunch of white space around
the content and save that, [1183] like so, [1186] and then we open it
again curiously. [1189] Nothing changes. [1192] Now, [1192] if you were
to go into at least visually, [1194] if you were to go into Microsoft
word and start banging on your enter key on either side of a heading.
[1201] Well, [1202] Microsoft word is a so called Wysiwyg file editor
with the wig standing for what you see is what you get. [1212] Um it’s
going to interpret those. [1221] That white space is meaningful. [1224]
Html is a little bit different in that regard. [1227] So the actual
rules for determining how this stuff happens is are pretty complicated,
[1236] But they’re also weirdly enough, [1238] they’re pretty intuitive
and I’ve never I’ve been doing this since I was 17 and I’ve never
really, [1243] I was kind of surprised when I learned that this was
actually a a thing that had rules. [1249] Um but it is interesting to
know that that white space actually is there and you can control whether
or not it appears or not, [1261] and we can prove that by using another
tag. [1264] And this tag is called pre tag P. [1267] R. [1267] E. [1268]
And that stands for preformatted text. [1271] So if we put this pre tag
underneath our tie heading and then we copy the content of that heading
into the pre tag and we display it, [1285] we’ll see that the space
actually renders the white space renders. [1294] So why this is has to
do with rules about defaults for different tags. [1301] So different
tags have different behaviors. [1304] Um We don’t usually actually want
this behavior, [1308] we don’t we actually believe or not collapsing
whitespace As we saw in the H one is a good thing because you don’t want
to have to have this kind of maniacal um attention to white space when
you’re actually composing an html file and typing an html file. [1338]
So let’s Add one more tag. [1342] This will be our fourth tag. [1344]
This is the p tag for a paragraph. [1347] And if we take our Hello world
text file and this time we just copy all of it clunk right into that tag
and save that and open it up. [1363] What do we see? [1365] Yeah. [1366]
Everything just runs together into a wall of text. [1371] So it looks
like an 1800s German tom like Von humboldt wrote this or something.
[1379] Um So you might ask yourself. [1386] Well that’s weird how it’s
how am I supposed to make things appear on their own line? [1393] And
this actually enters into one of the most interesting things about html
in my opinion,</p>
