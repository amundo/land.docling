# your first `HTML` document.

 So as we saw in the skill about plain text files, a plain text file is just a sequence of characters.


And we can in general we can talk about text “formats”: text files that obey certain rules of syntax: roughly, which characters can follow which other characters.

So `HTML` is one such format, and you may have seen or heard that there's such a thing as an `HTML` “tag”.

So we're going to learn just a handful of `HTML` tags and talk a little bit about why they work the way they do and where they come from.

But to get started we're just gonna jump right in and create an `HTML` file.

So in the same way that we made the text file before we will just create a new tab here in visual studio code and we'll save this file but this time instead of saving it with a dot txt as the file suffix,

We're going to save it with `.html`.

VS Code knows about `HTML` and it can help us to get our syntax right.
It does this by using what's called syntax highlighting and it will sort of dynamically as we type color code,

the content of the file to help us get,

make sure that we don't miss anything.

So to start with We'll be using just one tag and that tag is the title tag.

So if you just in your file we're going to make a title called Hello World.

And the way this works is that a tag has two parts.

It has an opening part and a closing part.

And and then it has content.

So `HTML` tags in our enclosed in less than and greater signs from math.

So like the math symbols.

So the opening tag has a less than sign and then the name of the tag and then a closing sign and then you have some content and then you have the closing tag which is the same as the opening tag except that after the less than sign you have a forward slash.

So as you can see I have written a title tag here and now I'll go to file save or use keyboard shortcut to save that file and it's saved to my desktop.

So that file now is an `HTML` file.

It so happens that it's not quite a valid `HTML` file,

but web browsers are fairly forgiving and it will render this.

Okay,

so the next step that we're gonna do is,

well what do you do with this thing once you've written a file that obeys the `HTML` format that is to say its contents match the syntax of `HTML` as it's defined in the standard for `HTML`.

What do you do with it?

Well,

typically you put it on the internet but there's another thing that you can do with that would just simply open it with a web browser in the same way that you would open,

say a Microsoft word file or in fact in the same way that we use that web browser are sorry the V.

S.

Code to edit a text file.

So we can just go to the browser.

We'll be using Firefox.
