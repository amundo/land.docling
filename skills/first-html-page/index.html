<p>[10] This skill is called your first html web page. [16] The skill is
called your first html document. [21] So as we saw in the skill about
plain text files? [30] A plain text file is just a sequence of
characters. [34] And we can in general we can talk about text formats
which are text files that obey certain rules about which characters can
follow which other characters. [59] It’s like a syntax. [61] So html is
one such format and you may have seen or heard that there’s such a thing
as an html tag. [72] So we’re going to learn just a handful of html tags
and talk a little bit about why they work the way they do and where they
come from. [83] But to get started we’re just gonna jump right in and
create an html file. [87] So in the same way that we made the text file
before we will yeah, [123] just create a new tab here in visual studio
code and we’ll save this file but this time instead of saving it with a
dot txt as the file suffix, [134] we’re going to save it with dot html.
[137] So V. [138] S code knows about html and it can help us to get our
syntax right? [144] So it does this by using what’s called syntax
highlighting and it will sort of dynamically as we type color code,
[153] the content of the file to help us get, [155] make sure that we
don’t miss anything. [158] So to start with We’ll be using just one tag
and that tag is the title tag. [172] So if you just in your file we’re
going to make a title called Hello World. [187] And the way this works
is that a tag has two parts. [191] It has an opening part and a closing
part. [194] And and then it has content. [197] So html tags in our
enclosed in less than and greater signs from math. [211] So like the
math symbols. [214] So the opening tag has a less than sign and then the
name of the tag and then a closing sign and then you have some content
and then you have the closing tag which is the same as the opening tag
except that after the less than sign you have a forward slash. [230] So
as you can see I have written a title tag here and now I’ll go to file
save or use keyboard shortcut to save that file and it’s saved to my
desktop. [260] So that file now is an html file. [265] It so happens
that it’s not quite a valid html file, [269] but web browsers are fairly
forgiving and it will render this. [272] Okay, [273] so the next step
that we’re gonna do is, [275] well what do you do with this thing once
you’ve written a file that obeys the html format that is to say its
contents match the syntax of html as it’s defined in the standard for
html. [289] What do you do with it? [290] Well, [291] typically you put
it on the internet but there’s another thing that you can do with that
would just simply open it with a web browser in the same way that you
would open, [299] say a Microsoft word file or in fact in the same way
that we use that web browser are sorry the V. [305] S. [305] Code to
edit a text file. [308] So we can just go to the browser. [312] We’ll be
using Firefox.</p>
