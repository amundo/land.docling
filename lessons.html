    <summary>About this course</summary>
    <p>
      The web platform is a complex system which has evolved over decades. Learning its ins and outs can seem overwhelming. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this course you will be guided through <em>just enough</em> of the details of the web platform to understand what it is, how it works, and what it can do. 
      While it would be unrealistic to expect that a single course could turn you into a professional web developer, you <em>can</em> learn to participate in the development of software for language documentation and description. Developing software, after all, involves much more than just writing software itself: at least as much work goes into specifying what software <em>should</em> do and <em>how</em> it should work as it does  into the actual code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning to specify these <em>whats</em> and <em>hows</em> in detail is a super power. By practicing this skill, you will become equipped participate in the development of software that meets your needs as a linguist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course is arranged into <strong>Lessons</strong> and <strong>Skills</strong>. Lessons are organized around building documents and applications that support the creation of digital versions of the “Boasian trilogy” — lexical, textual, and grammatical materials. Skills are bite-sized tutorials for the various technical skills that are applied in the creation of those documents and applications. Skills are largely self-guided, but you are welcome to discuss your experiences or any difficulties in the <a href="https://forum.docling.net">Docling forum</a>.

    <h4>Creating a web lexicon</h4>
    <p>
      In this “crash course” lesson to the web platform, we will walk through the development of a simple but effective bilingual lexicon. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, you will learn what the Web Platform is, and be introduced to its key technologies: <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JSON</code>, and <code>Javascript</code>. At the end of the lesson we will see some options for how the document can be deployed to the internet and shared with colleagues and friends.

    <h4>Building a searchable Boasian database</h4>
    <p>
      One drawback of the current suite of software tools in use in language documentation is the fact that different software tools use distinct data models.  This necessitates regimes of input/output, and consequently, of context switching as linguists are working. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson we will learn what data modeling is, and how a simple model can cover most of the types of content that constitute the Boasian trilogy.
